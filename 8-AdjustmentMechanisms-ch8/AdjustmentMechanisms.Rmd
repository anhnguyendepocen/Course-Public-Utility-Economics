## Some Problems with Rate Setting

+ Rate of return regulation is periodic
    + Either the utility or the PUC can start a new rate case
    + PUC if profits seem high
    + Utility if profits seem low
+ Usually 3-5 years between -- called "regulatory lag".
+ This may limit incentives to make cost reducing investments.
+ May cause wide swings in regulated prices (Fuel prices changing)

## How Regulatory Lag can Make Utilities more Efficient
