# Course Description

The official description of the course is:

> Examines the rationale, economic principles and institutions of historic economic regulation. Contemporary theory of the firm and microeconomic pricing are analyzed. Technological changes suggest that to achieve economic efficiency it may no longer be necessary or appropriate to subject energy and telecommunications firms to traditional utility regulation. There is academic enthusiasm for displacing economic regulation with competition. Deregulation and restructuring are explored with emphasis on contemporary issues in Oregon, the Pacific Northwest, and the nation. In particular, difficulties in transformation to the marketplace will be examined. Expert guest lecturers from the utility and regulatory communities will be scheduled, and contemporary scholarly literature will be reviewed.

Since I am teaching this course for the first time, there will be changes from previous terms and I will be making official changes in description and prerequisites during the year.  

This is a companion course to EC 438/538 which will address the development of energy markets. The order of the courses has changed to reflect the evolving nature of the field.

## Prerequisites

The undergraduate section has only the introductory economics courses listed as prerequisites.  The graduate section requires only graduate standing.  

As with most economics courses, the more background you bring to the class, the more get from the class.  For this class, it means bringing a background in microeconomic theory and econometrics.  Not all students will have a background in both and many of the graduate students from outside of economics will have neither.  Any technical skills that students are missing will be supplemented with in-class tutorials.  Sometimes this will mean learning about constrained optimization or breaking out laptops for a tutorial on running regressions in R.

# Topics and Readings

Do not let this section alarm you.  We will only address part of this outline in the class. As with most of my upper-division courses, we will complete a small subset at the start of the class and then vote on each succeeding topic. Each topic will have an assignment, usually working with real data or using a model from the readings.

Each topic has some readings that both undergraduates and graduate students will read and some that are specific to each. Note that some of these modules will be shared with the Public Utility Economics course and I will be adding optional topics and supplementary readings throughout the term.
